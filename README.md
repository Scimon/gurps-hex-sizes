# GURPS Hex Sizes
A module to support creatures from Size Modifier 0-6 for GURPS. Based on https://github.com/Ourobor/Hex-Size-Support

Currently supports three shapes more coming.
* Size Mod 0 (1x1 hex mostly for testing)
* Size Mod 0 Sleek (2x1 hex)
* Size Mod 1 Sleek (3x1 hex)
* Size Mod 1 Boxy (2x1 hex)
* Size Mod 2 Sleek (4x1 hex)
* Size Mod 2 Boxy (3x3 Hex)
* Size Mod 2 Upright (1x2 Hex) 

Rotation is done around the head hex as per the GURPS rules.

Note that for some sizes (Size 2 Upright for example) the rotation hex is added to the front of the figure.
