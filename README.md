# GURPS Hex Sizes
A module to support creatures from Size Modifier 0-6 for GURPS. Based on https://github.com/Ourobor/Hex-Size-Support

Currently supports three shapes more coming.
* Size Mod 0 (1x1 hex mostly for testing)
* Size Mod 0 Sleek (2x1 hex)
* Size Mod 1 Sleek (3x1 hex)

Rotation is done around the head hex as per the GURPS rules.

## Known Issues

Works with About Face but currently the indicator icons are not draw in the 
right location. If you disable indicator icons it still handles auto turning 
correctly.
